==suspect procedure about the problem with the level rendering in the second level:
R_DrawAlphaSurfaces in gl_rsurf line 655
==It can be! When the glich happens at the:
s := r_alpha_surfaces;
line, s becomes different of nil and we enter the loop in line 673

interesing line at gl_ramin:421. take a looke at the brushes.

interesting procedure at gl_rsurf:DrawGLPoly, is the line Inc(v, VERTEXSIZE);,
at line 243, doing the right thing? A: Apparently yes!

"procedure SV_CheckTimeouts();" in sv_main:1014 is the proable responsible

Take a look into cl_ents.pas:CL_AddPacketEntities, what is going on here?
