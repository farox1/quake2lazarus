==suspect procedure about the problem with the level rendering in the second level:
R_DrawAlphaSurfaces in gl_rsurf line 655
==It can be! When the glich happens at the:
s := r_alpha_surfaces;
line, s becomes different of nil and we enter the loop in line 673

interesing line at gl_ramin:421. take a looke at the brushes.

interesting procedure at gl_rsurf:DrawGLPoly, is the line Inc(v, VERTEXSIZE);,
at line 243, doing the right thing? A: Apparently yes!

"procedure SV_CheckTimeouts();" in sv_main:1014 is the proable responsible
for dropping the client for timeouts (happens a lot when debugging the code!)

Take a look into cl_ents.pas:CL_AddPacketEntities, what is going on here?

==on gl_rsurf:995:R_DrawInlineBModel the problematic surface index i is 1200, 1214,1216,1232, 1234.
